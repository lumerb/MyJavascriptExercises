# My Javascript Playground

This is a collection of my javascript coding exercises done throughout my career as a way of getting fit *javascriptically*.

The exercises are from different sources in the internet. I used some tests and some modern way of writing using ES6 syntax and Typescript.

I am very open for communication, comments or suggestions.
